            "description": "Soybeans are legume crops that prefer well-drained soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH level (around 6.0 to 7.0) and moderate temperatures (around 70-85°F). They require adequate moisture, especially during flowering and pod development stages, but excessive precipitation can lead to fungal diseases. Soybeans fix nitrogen from the air with the help of symbiotic bacteria, but additional nutrients like phosphorus and potassium are also essential.",
